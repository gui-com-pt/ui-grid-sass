# ui-grid-sass

A port to ui-grid LESS for SASS.

This project depends on pi-sass-mixins, a lightweight library including most of mixins used here. Because i've found direct references to .btn and .btn-size i don't know if ui-grid depends directly on bootstrap or not.

For the bootstrap i'm using bootstrap-sass.
